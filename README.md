   - **Status** (Field Type: Single Select) - Options: "Waitlist", "Invited", "Active"

### Step 3: Form Integration
Replace the current form handling in `script.js` with your Softr form integration:

```javascript
// Replace the form submission handler with your Softr integration
// The form will automatically send data to Airtable via Softr's API
```
